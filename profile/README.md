## Credits & Acknowledgments

**Based on**: UN1CA ROM

**Team:**

## Notice
Everything is properly credited - commits include original authors. 

**The Reality:**
- Push broken source = "bad practice" 
- Push working source = "code theft accusations"
- Even original implementations get called stolen code

We release source code when features are **working**, not to satisfy critics. Like with pipa mainline - we got audio working in a month, then released the full source.

**Bottom line:** Source gets pushed when it's ready, not when random people demand it.
